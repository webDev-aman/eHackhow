        What is Python?<br />
        Python is an object-oriented programming language created by Guido
        Rossum in 1989. It is ideally designed for rapid prototyping of complex
        applications. It has interfaces to many OS system calls and libraries
        and is extensible to C or C++. Many large companies use the Python
        programming language include NASA, Google, YouTube, BitTorrent, etc.<br />
        Python programming is widely used in Artificial Intelligence, Natural
        Language Generation, Neural Networks and other advanced fields of
        Computer Science. Python had deep focus on code readability &amp; this
